lowkey just plays a `.wav` and dips
first repo energy so don’t expect magic

💀 MID PROJECT (READ FAST)
It plays a WAV file. Windows/VS only. Path is fixed. No cap.

🚀 START
Clone: git clone [URL] then cd wav-player

Open: (need visual studio ofc )Double-click wav_player.sln.

RUN: Molest that F5 key. If no sound, your mixer is cooked. 🤷‍♂️

SONG SWAP (ASSETS FOLDER)
Put new_song.wav in Assets.

Change the path in wav_player.cpp: PlaySound(TEXT("..\\Assets\\new_song.wav")...);

F5.
